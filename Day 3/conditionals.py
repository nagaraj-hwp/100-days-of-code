# pizza order challenge
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.
# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
# Small pizza (S): $15
# Medium pizza (M): $20
# Large pizza (L): $25
# Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2
# Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3
# Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1

# print("Thank you for choosing Python Pizza Deliveries!")
# size = input() # What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L
# add_pepperoni = input() # Do you want pepperoni? Y or N
# extra_cheese = input() # Do you want extra cheese? Y or N

# bill = 0
# if size == "S":
#   bill += 15
# elif size == "M":
#   bill +=20
# elif size == "L":
#   bill += 25

# if add_pepperoni == "Y":
